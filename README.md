# 1D-Burgers-Equation-Simulation-using-Tensor-Networks

This project explores classical and quantum simulation of the 1D Burgers Equation. The classical part is implemented fully, while the quantum simulation using Tensor Networks (MPS/MPO) is in progress. The goal is to study how quantum-inspired methods can model PDEs. This project was done was a part of Quantum Program conducted by WISER and Womanium
